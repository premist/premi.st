I help taking video creation and digital marketing<br>
into the next level at [Shakr](https://www.shakr.com/).

I try to think in design mindset instead of letting<br>
technical limitations dictate user experience.<br>

My primary programming language of choice is Ruby,<br>
but I also write in other languages â€”<br>
Elixir, Swift, TypeScript, and more.

I love managing infrastructure and its state as a code,<br>
so I love tools which enable such concept like<br>
Terraform and Kubernetes.<br>
